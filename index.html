    <h1>Hot &amp; Cheesy Potato Casserole</h1>
    <p>This cheesy potato casserole brings zesty flavor to a classic comfort dish. Frozen potatoes are baked in a rich mix of cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and Sargento® Shreds with Frank's RedHot® Seasoning, creating a dish with just the right amount of heat. Topped with even more melted cheese for a golden finish, it’s a perfect side or hearty main.</p>
